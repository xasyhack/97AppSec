- ‚úÖ Restrict access to **trusted domains only**.
- üí° *AI Prompt Tip:* `"Set strict CORS policies."`

## 5. üîí Always Use HTTPS
- Encrypt all data in transit with **HTTPS**.
- ‚úÖ Ensure valid **SSL/TLS** certificates are used.
- üí° *AI Prompt Tip:* `"Force HTTPS in server configuration."`

## 6. üß† Regular Code Reviews
- Use both **AI tools** (e.g., Grok) and **human reviewers**.
- ‚úÖ Review for security issues before merging.
- üí° *AI Prompt Tip:* `"Scan for security flaws or injections."`

## 7. üìö Learn Security Basics
- Know key principles:
  - Principle of Least Privilege

- Automation: integration, testing, deployment, software delivery
- Define the SSDLC governance process: Security architecture review in the design phase, a shift left
- API security: authenticaiton ,authorization, encryption

# Secure SDLC
- Mindset: playbook, do you see what happened, scope (purpose of product), secure coding practices, data exposure and minimization, least priviledge and infra security, security tools and deployment, patch management, app monitoring and alerting, user training and awareness, endpoint security, incident response
- Automating Risk calculation: continuous application risk evaluation (CARE). Nature of app (data classification/compliance and regulation requirement), how is it built/maintained (tech stack), who is building and maintaining (experience of dev team)
- DevSecOps: Collaboration and Shared Responsibility, CI/CD, Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment, Automated Security Testing (SAST, DAST, SCA), Secure Configuuration and Secrets Management, Monitoring, Logging, and Incident Response
- Great SSDLC program: think (vision, strategic, customer feedback, driver, platform engineering), act (automation at all stages, threat detection, vulnerability management, CBA), persevere against challenge (lack of time, standarization, tech skills)
- CI/CI pipeline: run less than 10 mins, run for every commit, auto raised with engineer and into ticketing system, allow exceptions specific to env
- Serverless app: event driven, composed of multiple functions that are executed independently and asynchronously, multitenant cloud service susceptible to security risks (external, internal)
  - authentication and authorization
  - encryption (in transit and at rest): certs, encryption algorithms, secure key management
  - access controls
  - monitoring and loggin gmechanisms
  - testing and validation 
- Offensive security to defend: diff focus of developers and hackers (vulnerabilities, data exfiltration, how to manipulate user), response messages, API endpoints, admin features
- Cloud EraÔºösecure config, continuous logging and monitoring, data protection in multitenant env (data isolation, encryption, access control and authentication, vulnerability managment, security monitoring, logggin, contractual agreement, regular security assessment), adopt clod access security brokers (data encryption, access control, threat prevention)
- Code Provenance/ownership: code signing, require verified commits, maintain audit logs and commit history, SBOMS to track components and dependencies (Syft, cycloneDx, Anchore, Trivy), tag builds and artifacts with Metadata, use immutable infra & images, source dependencies from approved respositories, doc provenance polices, developer identity & access control (SSO/MFA, RBAC)

# Data Security & Privacy

- Data-Flow Analysis  
- Privacy Paradigm: data ownership, Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), consent, Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation, decentralized data storage, privacy by design
- Quantum-Safe Encryption: quantum computers potentially breaks asymmetric encryption RSA & ECC (SSL/TLS, digital signatures, secure key exchange to ensure integrity and confidentiality of data). Look for quantum random number generators (QRNGs) generate truly random numbers that are unpredictable and nonreproducible,

# Code Scanning & Testing
- SCA: analyzing dependency manifest files to identify vulnerabilities associated with the included package.
  - Call graph‚Äìbased based SCA pinpointing the potential exploited code
  - Runtime SCA analyzes software dependencies in real time
- App security testing
  - SAST: early detection (development phase), scan large codebased, high FP, apply on CI/CD pipelines
  - DAST: Realistic testing, runtime context, low FP, late detection, Incomprehensive coverage, apply on testing env
  - SCA: identification of known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries, open-source components, high coverage of commonly used libraries, often relies on CVEs, quick feedback, and easy integration into CI/CD pipelines, apply on development phase and continuous monitoring for updates
  - IAST: hybrid of SAST & DASDT, more accurate identification of vulnerabilities, deeper insight, Performance overhead, Deployment complexity, apply on staging env
- WAF: analyzing incoming traffic and filtering out malicious requests and attacks. Advantages of Layered defense, Ease of deployment, Signature-based protection, performance. Downsite of tuning, alert fatigue, limited context
- RASP: monitors the application‚Äôs behavior for suspicious activities. Advantages of Deeper contextual insights and accurate results, real-time protection and zero-day protection, Little to no tuning required. Downsite of performance, Integration challenges, need framework knowledge
- Zero Trust Software Architecture: identitity access, never trust data, Proactively test for security misconfigurations, STRIDE reduce attack surfaces
- CI/CD: risks include code injection, Secret/credential hygiene, Misconfiguration. Hyginene steps include access control to acccess pipeline, KMS or Key vault to protect credential, secure build env, code review, security best practices (password management, least privilege access, and regular software updates)

# Vulnerability Management
- Bug bounty program: Use an existing platform, Implement guardrails, Define payouts, Test in production
